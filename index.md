Welcome to the 2022-2023 Capstone project. Here, you will find all
the basic details you need to build a working example of sentiment
analysis with Astra DB and Astra Streaming.

## Introduction

Hello students! Welcome to industry Capstone with DataStax. Your Data Science Capstone industry mentors for the next two terms will be Derrick Cosmas and Jonathan Shook, both from DataStax. We will also have Justin Eldrdige from UCSD to assist during discussion and office hours.

The project will focus on using Machine Learning to do sentiment analysis on the Twitter firehose. A good paper for background is [Sentiment Analysis Based on Deep Learning: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2006/2006.03541.pdf).

This capstone program is designed to mentor you, the students in building real world projects. We expect you to to drive the direction of your own project and excellence will come from the planning and execution you put into the project. 

The best way for the staffs to help you succeed will be by answering your questions during discussion and office hours. These questions should be regarding blockers that you might encounter throughout all phases of the project. Having those questions answered should give you the clarity to move your project forward throughout the quarters. Come prepared with questions for every session as they are designed to help you, rather than the staffs.

## Section Participation

Participation in the weekly discussion section is *mandatory*. Each
week, you are responsible for doing the reading/task assigned in the
schedule. Come to section prepared to ask questions about
and discuss the results of these tasks. Think of these questions as problems 
you need help with in moving your project forward.

Each week, turn in answers to the weekly questions to Canvas. These
questions are meant to focus your work for the week and help prepare
you for discussion. If you have questions about your work, please ask
them in section or office hours (We will rarely comment on your
submission).

You are responsible for the entire weekly reading/task, even if
portions are not covered in the weekly questions. The weekly tasks are
the building blocks for the project proposals/assignments due at the
end of the quarter.

## Schedule

**No participation questions are required to be completed before Week 1. 
First set of Participation Questions are due on Week 2**
