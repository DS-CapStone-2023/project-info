# Week 2 - Twitter Firehose

## Topics

This week, we'll be introduced to the paper and prepare to collect a Twitter dataset. We'll:

* get set up to download data from the Twitter API;
* get started with Astra streaming
* start reading the background paper that we'll base our work in.

## Readings

Please read the following before our next meeting:

* To use the Twitter API, you must be approved for developer access. Read the instructions here and apply for a single-user developer key.
You will be asked several questions about how you will use the API; 
the approval process is done by humans, so the quality of your answers is very important. 
Here are some tips:
    * Outline what information you are trying to learn from using the API (e.g. botting in social networks, social movements, misinformation spread)    
    * Use your UCSD email -- this gives your request more credibility.
    * Mention that this is for a class, DSC 180, at UC San Diego. You can include my name as well.
    * Twitter may send a follow-up email asking for more information. You can reply by paraphrasing the below:
       * The core use case is academic research in social network dynamics. 
         We will be studying <Insert your topic>. This will be part of a senior capstone project at UC San Diego.
         We will analyze the content of tweets only to determine how URLs/hashtags are being shared. We will not be analyzing individual users as such. 
         We will not be posting, retweeting, or otherwise interacting with other user accounts. Our use of the API will be strictly read-only.
         Twitter content itself will not be displayed off twitter. 
         Aggregated information about the dynamics of twitter conversation will be displayed in academic venues only.

* Read about the [Twitter API's restricted use cases](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases)
