# Week 6 - Scaling

## Quarter 1 Project Checkpoint

Checkpoint is due on **October 30th**.  

Submit a working title, abstract, and introduction for their Quarter 1 Project, which is a replication of our main paper.

While you can take various creative liberties with the project, essential **requirements** for the replication are specifically:

1. Project objective is framed around remote work within context of Covid-19.
2. Demonstrate the sentiment analysis methods described in the research paper.
3. Your results must answer your defined objective, i.e. what is the sentiment of the population you are analyzing towards remote work within your own Covid-19 context.
4. Use the Twitter API for your raw input stream.
5. Use a streaming function for your classification pipeline.

## Additional Office Hours

OPTIONAL: We are offering office hours this week (Week 6) Thursday and Fridays  around 2PM to 4PM PDT for each team.

This is to have a more focused discussion on your checkpoint submission. 

## Topics

This week we will be discussing about Scaling and Optimization on why are they important and how they differ.

## Homework

- Preprocess your tweets data to be ingested by the model of your choosing. TF-IDF ? Word embedding? Document your process.

## Discussion Questions

Participation questions are due 24 hours before next week discussion meeting.  

1. How does scaling differ from optimization?
2. Describe an example where you want to distribute your work over resources or over time.
3. Imagine you are explaining to your CTO that you need a particular optimization, how do you convince said CTO that particular optimization is needed?
