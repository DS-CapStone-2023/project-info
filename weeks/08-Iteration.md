# Week 8 - Iteration and Integration

This week we will be discussing about how to iterate effectively and integrating with API.

Please read the [twelve factor methodology](https://12factor.net/) before the class. These twelve factors are important guiding principles for any software or app development.

## Participation Questions

Please answer the following three questions for this week participation:

1. At which point in your project should you start thinking about operational capabilities i.e. 12  factor methodology ?
2. How do you decide what functionalities you want to implement in a public API? You can look at examples such as the Twitter API you have been using.
3. What has been the most challenging aspect of building your current demo? What have you learned about managing projects?
