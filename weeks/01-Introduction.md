# Week 1 - Introduction 

In our first class, we want to outline our goal for the quarter. 
See Week 2 for first assigned reading and for instructions on getting set up with the Twitter API.

This project provides experience in deploying an application of data science in a production environment. We will work through design considerations for building and maintaining the production version of this application.

Our topic focus will on **Sentiment Analysis**. Along the way, we will:
1. Ingest a livestream of Tweets for a selected series of topics.
2. Create a sequence of streams that transform tweets, measure sentiment, and produce real-time analytics.
3. Explore options for visualizing results
