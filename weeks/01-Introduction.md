# Week 1 - Introduction 

In our first class, we want to outline our goal for the quarter. 

This project provides experience in deploying an application of data science in a production environment. We will work through design considerations for building and maintaining the production version of this application.

Our topic focus will on **Sentiment Analysis**. Along the way, we will:
1. Ingest a livestream of Tweets for a selected series of topics.
2. Create a sequence of streams that transform tweets, measure sentiment, and produce real-time analytics.
3. Explore options for visualizing results

## Your 2022/2023 Industry Advisors

Derrick Cosmas will be your discussion coordinator in this course. In his own words, Derrick is a recent graduate from UCSD ECE Master's in Data Science. His current work is building automated resource scaling.

Jonathan Shook will be your subject matter expert in this course. In his own words, Shook is a distributed systems technologist who enjoys holistic system design with a focus on scalability and performance.

## Feedback and Questions

Please do not hesitate to come to us with questions during discussion and office hours. We also have a discord channel where you can interact with other students and advisors. Emails are also open for asking questions

## Reading

Read the background paper [Sentiment Analysis Based on Deep Learning: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2006/2006.03541.pdf)

## Participation Questions

Participation questions are due 24 hours before next week discussion meeting.

Answer the following questions for this week (2-3 sentences each task):

* Describe one thing you found interesting in the reading. Describe what it is in your own words and why you found it interesting.
* Describe one thing that you found difficult to understand. Try to be specific about what you donâ€™t think you understand.
* Desrcribe which combination of text conversion methods (TF-IDF, Word Embedding) and deep learning methods (DNN, CNN, RNN) you would use for Twitter sentiments and why you would use it?
