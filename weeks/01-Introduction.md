# Week 1 - Introduction 

In our first class, we introduced the streaming and outlined our goal for the quarter. 
See Week 2 for the first assigned reading and for instructions on getting set up with the Twitter API.

This project provides experience in deploying an application of data science in a production environment. We will work through design considerations for building and maintaining the production version of this application. Along the way, we will:
1. Ingest a livestream of Tweets for a selected series of topics.
2. Create a sequence of streams that transform tweets, measure sentiment, and produce real-time analytics.
3. Design an intuitive UI for real-time monitoring of sentiment.
4. Deploy a lightweight web app for real-time viewing.
5. Iterate through test driven design for an optimal user experience.
