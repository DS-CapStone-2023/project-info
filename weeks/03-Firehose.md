## Discussion Questions

Participation questions are due 24 hours before next week discussion meeting.  

Project Proposal are due on Week 5 so I would like to get a sense of how far you are on the reading. 

With respect to our **main paper**, answer the following questions:
* Describe one thing you found interesting in the reading. Describe what it is in your own words and why you found it interesting.
* Describe one thing that you found difficult to understand. Try to be specific about what you donâ€™t think you understand.
* In preparation for your Week 5 proposal, describe and justify in detail, the context and objective of your prediction regarding remote work sentiment. Some of the questions to help structure your answer:
  * What are your sentiment labels (happy, unhappy, mixed, neutral, strong dislike, etc) and why do you decide to use these labels
  * How would you label your dataset using the labels above ? 
  * How would you construct your training dataset ?
  * How would you measure accuracy of your model ?
  * Can you think of the biases you are introducing to your dataset and prediction model ? (demographics, keywords)
