# Week 5 - Structured Data

## Quarter 1 Project Checkpoint

Checkpoint is due on **October 30th**.  

Submit a working title, abstract, and introduction for their Quarter 1 Project, which is a replication of our main paper.

While you can take various creative liberties with the project, essential **requirements** for the replication are specifically:

1. Project objective is framed around remote work within context of Covid-19.
2. Demonstrate the sentiment analysis methods described in the research paper.
3. Use the Twitter API for your raw input stream.
4. Use a streaming function for your classification pipeline.

## Topics

This week we will be discussing about Structure in databases and apps.

After this discussion you should be able to answer the following questions:
1. What do we mean by schemaless ? Are (key,value) schema considered schemaless ?
2. What do we mean by “implied structure” ?

## Homework

You do not have to submit this at Gradescope, but you should attempt doing these items to get started on your project:

1. Start consuming data from the twitter API and see hook it up the feed into a Pulsar streaming topic via a Python script or some other methods.
2. Start sketching out your classification (or training) pipelines. Document this in a way that can be useful for your proposal. Visual narratives are powerful and should be part of any good presentation. Clarity around active processing elements, data flows, and key responsibilities is crucial.

When designing and coding your solution, always keep in mind the **4 project requirements** outlined above

## Discussion Questions

Participation questions are due 24 hours before next week discussion meeting.  

1. Why is structure important for scaling web applications?
2. Why is schema important for data hygiene?
3. Can you describe a scenario in which it is better to leave your data in unstructured form?
